The job interview is the decisive moment in the recruitment process. It's where the fit between the candidate and the role is really assessed—beyond the skills listed on the CV.

Yet too many interviews are conducted without structured preparation, with generic questions that don't allow for a real evaluation of the candidate.

## The problem with unprepared interviews

### Classic mistakes

Most hiring managers fall into the same traps:

- **Stock questions**: "Tell me about yourself", "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
- **Confirmation bias**: seeking to validate a first impression rather than evaluating objectively
- **Missing key points**: not digging into the grey areas of the CV
- **Lack of structure**: interviews that go in all directions

### The consequences

A poorly prepared interview leads to:
- Costly hiring mistakes (a bad hire costs an average of €45,000)
- A poor candidate experience
- Decisions based on "gut feeling" rather than objective criteria

## AI at the service of the interview

### How does it work?

Modern tools like Seeklon analyze:
1. **The candidate's CV**: background, skills, experience
2. **The job description**: essential criteria, required skills
3. **The gap between the two**: points to validate, areas to explore

From this analysis, the AI generates a **personalized interview guide**.

### What an AI interview guide contains

**Contextualized suggested questions**

> "You mention having managed a team of 3 people at [Company X]. Can you give me a concrete example of a difficult situation you had to handle with your team?"

**Identified points to watch**

> "The candidate indicates proficiency in Python, but their experience seems mainly in data. To validate: level in pure backend development."

**Soft skills to assess**

> "The role requires strong autonomy. Explore: how does the candidate organize their work without direct supervision?"

## Concrete benefits

### For the recruiter

- **Time saved**: no need to reread the CV 10 times before the interview
- **Structure**: a clear thread so nothing is forgotten
- **Objectivity**: evaluation criteria defined in advance
- **Professionalism**: a positive impression on the candidate

### For the candidate

- **Quality interview**: relevant questions about their background
- **Feeling of being heard**: the recruiter knows their file
- **Fairness**: the same evaluation framework for all candidates

### For the company

- **Better hires**: decisions based on data
- **Reduced turnover**: better job-candidate fit
- **Employer brand**: reputation as a company that hires well

## Best practices for using an AI interview guide

### Personalize

The guide is a starting point, not a script. Adapt the questions to your style and the context of the conversation.

### Take notes

Use the guide to structure your notes during the interview. You'll be able to compare candidates objectively.

### Keep the human at the center

AI prepares, humans decide. The guide helps you ask the right questions, but your judgment counts for the final decision.

## Conclusion

AI doesn't replace the recruiter's intuition. It gives them the tools to run more relevant, fair, and effective interviews.

At Seeklon, the interview guide is generated automatically for every candidate you want to meet. One click, and you're ready.
