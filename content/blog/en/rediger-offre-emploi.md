In a job market where qualified candidates have choices, your job posting is your first sales pitch. Studies show that **76% of candidates** drop out if the posting is poorly written or incomplete.

Yet most job postings look the same: an endless list of tasks, unrealistic requirements, and the famous "salary depending on profile" that drives away the best candidates.

Here's the complete guide to writing a job posting that actually attracts the talent you're looking for.

## 1. Job title: specific and searchable

### Common mistakes

- Overly creative titles: "Code Ninja" or "Sales Rockstar" may be catchy but aren't what people search for on job boards
- Too vague: "Project Officer" doesn't help candidates picture the role
- Internal jargon: "Alpha Project Lead" only means something to your team

### Best practice

Use the title candidates actually type into job search. You can check with tools like Google Trends or Indeed Hiring Insights.

**Optimized examples:**
- "Full Stack JavaScript Developer – React/Node.js"
- "B2B SaaS Sales – Enterprise"
- "Digital Marketing Manager – E-commerce"

## 2. The hook: grab attention in 3 lines

The first lines of your posting determine whether the candidate keeps reading. Skip the classic corporate intro.

### What to avoid

> "A market leader for 20 years, our innovative company is seeking to support its growth..."

### What works

> "Want to build the product that will transform how SMBs recruit? Join a team of 15 in fast growth, where every developer has a direct impact on the product."

The hook should answer one simple question: **why is this role exciting?**

## 3. The mission: impact over tasks

### The task-list trap

A list of 15 daily task bullet points is counterproductive. It makes the role feel repetitive and discourages ambitious candidates.

### The impact approach

Describe **why** the role exists and **what impact** the person will have on the company.

**Example 1 – Community Manager**
- ❌ *Task approach*: "Manage social media"
- ✅ *Impact approach*: "Build and grow a community of 50,000 followers"

**Example 2 – Sales**
- ❌ *Task approach*: "Do cold calling"
- ✅ *Impact approach*: "Open the SMB market by signing 30 new clients per quarter"

**Example 3 – Developer**
- ❌ *Task approach*: "Develop features"
- ✅ *Impact approach*: "Design the technical architecture that will support 100x our growth"

## 4. Salary: transparency pays off

### The numbers

According to Glassdoor:
- **85%** of candidates consider salary a top criterion
- Postings that show a salary range get **30% more applications**
- **67%** of candidates don't apply if salary isn't mentioned

### How to present compensation

If you can't give an exact figure, offer a realistic range:

> "Compensation: $50,000 – $65,000 per year depending on experience, + variable up to $10K"

Also mention benefits: health insurance, meal vouchers, remote work, PTO, profit-sharing, etc.

## 5. Skills: separate must-haves from nice-to-haves

### The "unicorn profile" mistake

Requiring 10 "essential" skills has two negative effects:
1. You discourage capable candidates who don't tick every box
2. You attract candidates who overstate their skills

### The right structure

**Essential (3–5 criteria max):**
- At least 3 years of experience in web development
- Proficiency in React and Node.js
- Fluent English

**Nice to have (bonus, not blocking):**
- Experience in a startup environment
- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Open source contributions

## 6. The company: show your culture, not just your logo

### What candidates really want to know

- How does day-to-day work look? (Methods, tools, rituals)
- What's the remote work policy?
- How does onboarding work?
- What are the growth opportunities?

### Differentiators to mention

- **Flexibility**: "Full remote OK" or "3 days remote per week"
- **Team**: "You'll join a team of 5 senior developers"
- **Tech stack**: for tech roles, detail the tools you use
- **Growth**: "We've doubled headcount in 1 year"

## 7. The recruitment process: set expectations

A candidate who knows the steps can picture the journey. Describe it simply:

> **Our process:**
> 1. 20-minute phone call with our HR team
> 2. 1-hour technical interview with the Lead Developer
> 3. Meeting with the team and CEO (1 hour)
> 4. Response within 48 hours after the last interview

## Bonus: SEO keywords for your posting

To get your posting well indexed on job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.), naturally include:

- The exact job title
- Location (city + region)
- Contract type (full-time, contract, freelance)
- Experience level (junior, mid-level, senior)
- Key technologies or skills for the role

## Pre-publish checklist

Before publishing, check:

- [ ] The title is clear and searchable
- [ ] The hook grabs attention in under 3 lines
- [ ] Missions describe impact, not tasks
- [ ] Salary or a range is mentioned
- [ ] Skills are prioritized (essential vs nice-to-have)
