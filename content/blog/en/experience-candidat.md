You've probably been there: you apply to a job that excites you, you tailor your application, and then... nothing. Radio silence. Not even an automatic confirmation email.

This phenomenon has a name: **candidate ghosting**. And it costs companies that practice it dearly.

## Candidate experience: a business issue, not just HR

### The figures that matter

According to the 2025 candidate experience barometer (Yaggo x IFOP):

- **72%** of candidates share a bad recruitment experience on social media or with their network
- **52%** of candidates would turn down an offer from a company that treated them poorly, even for a higher salary
- **1 in 3 candidates** is also a customer or prospect of the company
- Average cost of a bad employer reputation: **10% extra cost per hire**

### The virtuous circle of candidate experience

A well-treated candidate, even if rejected, can become:
- An **ambassador** who recommends your company
- A **future candidate** who will apply again later
- A **customer** who will choose your products or services
- A **referral source** who will send you qualified profiles

## The 5 pillars of a great candidate experience

### 1. Immediate acknowledgment

**The bare minimum**: confirm receipt of every application within 24 hours.

An automatic email is enough, as long as it is:
- Personalized with the candidate's name and job title
- Informative about expected response times
- Signed by a real person (not "The Recruitment Team")

**Example of an effective email:**

> Hi Marie,
>
> Thank you for your application for the Full Stack Developer position.
>
> Our team will review your profile carefully. You will receive a response within 10 days at the latest.
>
> In the meantime, feel free to check out our blog and latest updates.
>
> Best regards,
> Thomas, Recruitment Manager

### 2. Transparency about the process

Before even applying, the candidate should know:

- How many steps are in the process?
- Who will they meet?
- What's the average time between application and decision?
- What types of assessments are planned (technical test, case study, etc.)?

This transparency has a double benefit:
- It reassures strong candidates who will invest more
- It naturally filters out those who aren't truly motivated

### 3. Respecting announced timelines

If you say you'll respond within 10 days, **keep that commitment**. Nothing is more frustrating for a candidate than waiting with no news after the promised date.

If you're unexpectedly delayed, proactively inform them:

> "Our decision process is taking longer than expected. We'll get back to you before [date]. Thank you for your patience."

### 4. Constructive feedback

The rejection is the trickiest moment, but also the one with the biggest impact on your employer brand.

**What to avoid:**
- Generic rejection emails with no explanation
- Silence (the worst)
- Empty phrases: "Your profile doesn't match our current needs"

**What makes the difference:**

> Hi Marie,
>
> After reviewing your application, we've decided not to move forward with your candidacy for this position.
>
> We prioritized profiles with more in-depth experience in microservices architecture, which is essential for this project.
>
> Your web development background is solid nonetheless. We're keeping your profile on file and will be sure to reach out if a more suitable opportunity comes up.
>
> I wish you every success in your search.

This type of response takes 2 extra minutes but turns a rejection into a positive experience.

### 5. Humanizing interactions

Behind every application is a person who has invested time and energy. A few simple practices humanize the relationship:

- **Call instead of email** when sharing good news
- **Offer a debrief** even when rejecting strong candidates
- **Give advice** for the next steps in the candidate's journey
- **Stay available** to answer questions

## How automation improves candidate experience

### The automation paradox

It's counterintuitive, but **automating certain tasks lets you be more human**. By delegating repetitive tasks to technology, you free up time for high-value interactions.

### What can be automated

**Acknowledgment**
- *Automation*: Personalized automatic email
- *Benefit*: Instant response 24/7

**Application screening**
- *Automation*: AI scoring by relevance
- *Benefit*: Fair and fast treatment

**Candidate follow-up**
- *Automation*: Scheduled emails
- *Benefit*: No candidate left behind

**Interview scheduling**
- *Automation*: Online booking tool
- *Benefit*: Fewer email back-and-forths

### What must stay human

- Announcing the final decision (positive or negative)
- Personalized feedback after an interview
- Salary negotiation
- Onboarding and integration

## The cost of ghosting vs. investing in experience

### The hidden cost of a bad experience

- **Reputation**: negative reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, Google
- **Virality**: a dissatisfied candidate tells an average of 9 people
- **Recruitment cost**: harder to attract candidates, higher salaries to offset a bad image
- **Lost customers**: 1 in 3 candidates is also a potential customer

### The ROI of a great candidate experience

- **Referrals**: well-treated candidates recommend profiles
- **Talent pool**: rejected candidates come back for other roles
- **Employer brand**: positive reviews that attract new candidates
- **Engagement**: hires after a good experience are more engaged
